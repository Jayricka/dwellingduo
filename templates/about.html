        <h2>About DwellingDuo</h2>
        <p>
            DwellingDuo was inspired by the challenges faced during my apartment hunt, including transportation costs, 
            time spent searching for suitable homes, and experiences with fraudulent caretakers and scammers. 
            Our mission is to streamline the rental process, making it easier and safer for tenants and landlords to connect.
        </p>
        <p>
            This project serves as my portfolio for Holberton School, and it reflects my passion for creating 
            meaningful solutions that enhance the user experience. With DwellingDuo, I aim to provide a platform that 
            ensures a positive experience for all users, allowing them to focus on what truly mattersâ€”finding a home.
