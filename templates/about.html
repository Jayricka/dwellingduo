        <h2>About DwellingDuo</h2>
        <p>
            DwellingDuo was born from the challenges faced during my apartment hunt, such as transportation costs, 
            countless hours spent searching for suitable homes, and unfortunate experiences with fraudulent caretakers 
            and scammers. Our mission is simple yet powerful: <strong>to streamline the rental process</strong> and make 
            it <strong>easier and safer for tenants and landlords to connect</strong>.
        </p>
        <p>
            This project serves as my portfolio for Holberton School. It reflects my passion for crafting meaningful 
            solutions that prioritize <strong>user experience</strong>. With DwellingDuo, I aim to provide a platform 
            where all users can enjoy a <strong>seamless experience</strong>, helping them focus on what matters mostâ€” 
            <strong>finding a home</strong>.
